# SeattleAirBNB
This Tableau project presents a comprehensive analysis of real estate prices across different zip codes and bedroom counts, offering valuable insights into price distribution, average prices by zipcode, and the relationship between the number of bedrooms and property prices. The data was pulled from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?select=reviews.csv).

The dashboard which features various graphs and maps can be fully viewed on Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/views/SeattleAirBNB_17223732413380/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

While it was a fun project, this dashboard could serve real AirBNB investors by providing a clear and interactive way to explore Seattle AirBNB dynamics, allowing them to make data-driven decisions based on property prices, location, and size.
